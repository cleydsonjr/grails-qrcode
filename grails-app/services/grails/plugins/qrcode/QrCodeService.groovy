/**

 * This is a prototype scoped service. That means that each new reference
 * to this service is a new copy. That's fine in this case as the service
 * is completely free of any request, session, or thread related concerns.
 * <p/>
 * In Grails, controllers are created new on each request. That means that
 * your controller gets a new copy of this service on each incoming request.
 * The previous version created a new instance of this renderer on each
 * request. That's because this POGO is at least as light weight as a Closure
 * and we got new instances of each closure on every request as well.
